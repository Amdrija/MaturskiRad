# Sorting Algorithm Animation
This is a simple static webpage made as a school graduation project for depicting how various sorting algorithms work by using animations. You can visit it on GitHub pages by clicking on this link https://amdrija.github.io/SortingAlgorithmAnimation/.
There are 4 algorithms that are presented here: 
 - **Quick sort**
 - **Bubble sort**
 - **Insertion sort**
 - **Counting sort**  

This project was made when I was still in high school and I haven't reviewed it since. Back then, I didn't know a lot about good coding practices, so there are probably many mistakes.
